# üß¨ Data Science Methods Evaluation: Assumptions in Diverse Datasets

![Let's Get Started](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abKhOpu0NwenH3O/giphy.gif)

## Project Plan ‚Äì Submission for Thursday, April 10

### üìö Course Information

This project is part of the **Data Science in Bio** course offered at the **University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)** in **Spring 2025**.  
- **Department:** Computer Science  
- **Instructor:** Dr. Jianhua Ruan

### üîç Project Overview

For this project, we will pursue **Option 2**: an in-depth evaluation of one or more data science methods applied to diverse datasets‚Äîspanning both biological and non-biological domains. Our primary goal is to critically examine the **assumptions** underlying selected data science techniques and how those assumptions hold (or fail) in practice across different types of data.

We aim to highlight the **impact of assumption violations** on results and interpretations, providing clear demonstrations through visualization and analysis.

### üë• Team Composition

- **Nadia (Fatemeh Sadat) Masoumi**
- **Patrick McLaughlin**

### üß™ Planned Methods

We are considering the following methods for in-depth evaluation:

- **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction and visualization  
- **t-test** and/or **DESeq2** for differential analysis

We will analyze the **theoretical assumptions** behind each method, including but not limited to:

- Distributional assumptions (e.g., normality for t-test)
- Distance preservation (for t-SNE)
- Dispersion modeling in count data (for DESeq2)

### üìÅ Possible Data Sources

- **Biological Datasets**
  - GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)
  - TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)

- **Non-Biological Datasets**
  - MNIST and Fashion-MNIST (image data)
  - UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets (e.g., Iris)
  - Synthetic datasets from `scikit-learn` to create controlled violations of assumptions

---



### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

_This README will evolve throughout the project as we finalize our method(s), datasets, and results._
